New Demos

#### Sep 15, 2012

I edited this text on an iPad with a Bluetooth Apple keyboard.
The return and backwards delete keys work. The arrow keys and control keys, neither Cmd nor Ctrl, work. But the biggest problem is that you cannot scroll the edit pane vertically.

**Hello** - hello world for Rascal (displays message, flashes LED). See [hello world][1] for more info.

**Upload CF** - upload image files using Choose File dialog  
**Upload DD** - upload image files using drag and drop from desktop

> _- before running the above, click the Create Folder icon to create a directory static/uploads/_

**Album** - upload image files using drag and drop and view as picture album

> _- before running album, click the Create Folder icon to create a directory static/pictures/_

**Email** - sends an email message via an external SMTP server

> _- requires an external email account that provides an SMTP server, for example a gmail account. To set up Rascal to send emails, please follow the instructions at the bottom of the email page._
